# drc-ggplot2: Enhanced Visualizations for Dose-Response Curves in R

The `drc-ggplot2` repository is an extension of the `drc` R package, providing sophisticated `ggplot2` visualizations to enhance dose-response analysis.

The `drc` package in R is a powerful tool for fitting dose-response curves, however, it has limitations in terms of customizable and aesthetically pleasing graphics. This is where `drc-ggplot2` comes in, offering the flexibility and power of the `ggplot2` package to create highly customizable and publication-quality graphics for your dose-response data.

## Key Features

- **User-friendly interface**: The package has been designed with simplicity in mind, allowing even novices to create beautiful and complex visualizations.
  
- **Customizable visuals**: `drc-ggplot2` extends the plotting capabilities of `drc` by leveraging `ggplot2` functionalities. Customize your dose-response curves with different color schemes, themes, scales, facets, and much more.

- **Enhanced output**: Create high-resolution graphics suited for both presentations and publications.

- **Detailed tutorials**: Get started quickly with our comprehensive vignettes and examples.

- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with the `drc` package. `drc-ggplot2` works smoothly with `drc` objects.

With `drc-ggplot2`, your dose-response curves will not only be statistically rigorous but also visually impressive. It's an essential tool for any researcher or data analyst working with dose-response data in R.
